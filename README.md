"InspectorNet" is a sophisticated neural network architecture developed with the aim of filtering out inappropriate video content, specifically focusing on identifying explicit content like pornography and violence, within animated cartoons. Leveraging the power of Keras Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), InspectorNet is designed to analyze and classify video frames, making it capable of accurately identifying objectionable scenes. Trained meticulously on the Danbooru dataset, the neural network has undergone rigorous learning to discern visual patterns associated with explicit content. By harnessing its deep learning capabilities, InspectorNet contributes to creating a safer and more appropriate content consumption environment for users, ensuring that animated cartoons remain suitable for all audiences.
