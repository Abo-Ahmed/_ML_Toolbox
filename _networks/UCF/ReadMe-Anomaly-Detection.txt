1. Anomaly Detection Experiment

Videos:
Anomaly-Videos-Part-1 -- Part-4 (4 zip files)
Training-Normal-Videos-Part-1.zip and Training-Normal-Videos-Part-2.zip (normal videos for training)
Testing_Normal_Videos.zip (normal videos for testing)

UCF_Crimes-Train-Test-Split.zip contains the traing and testing split in our experiments
(folder: Anomaly_Detection_splits)



2. Anomaly Event Recognition Experiment

Classify 13 anomaly events and normal event

Normal_Videos_for_Event_Recognition.zip contains the normal videos we used for event recognition experiment
Note: rename the unziped folder to "Normal_Videos_event"

UCF_Crimes-Train-Test-Split.zip also contains the traing and testing split for event recognition experiment
(folder: Action_Regnition_splits)
